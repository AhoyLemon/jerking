    description: "Short on cash? Why pay for talent, when you can just get Tony from Round the Way to put the whole thing on film for you? Tony's never been involved in pornography production before, and between me and you we both know that he'll probably fuck it up, but let's not ignore the fact that he'll do it for free. Why? I'm sure he has his reasons, and I'm sure if he told you his reasons, you'd be uncomfortable."

    description: "Nobody on earth has been in the pornography business longer than Broadway Bob, and few people on this Earth are less pleasant to be around. When a pornographer in the city has a pair of genitals and a hundred bucks, the default response to call Broadway Bob to film them touching each other. It shouldn't surprise you to know that Broadway Bob is a vitriolic homophobe, and the only thing he'll ever film is a penis in a vagina. But if you're lucky, maybe some faces will show up by accident."

      "aureolas"
    ],
    description: "Let's get this out of the way first: Apparently it's pronounced &quot;soo-shus&quot;. Now what kind of person names themself Seioucxious? The kind of person who carries around their magazine clipping heralding her as &quot;The most important up and coming director in austere queerporn.&quot; Disregarding the fact that this clipping is from seven years ago, Seioucxious' back catalogue of GLBT-friendly pornography gives her some credibility. You'll just have to deal with the fact that each video she makes starts with a 36 minute opus about &quot;The Mind Vagina&quot;, but you might get hot sex afterwards. Oh, and this should go without saying, but if you hire Seioucxious, it's No Breeders Allowed."

      "brutalism",

      "sodomy"
    ],
    description: "Bringing a macabre and existentialist view to his pornography, Gunther Von Arsch makes films celebrating the agression of human existance in the eye of a cruel and senseless God. Oh, and also buttsex. There's plenty of buttsex too. So yeah, let's say maybe 40% sardonic angst, and 60% sodomy. Or something close to that, anyway."

      "questionable hairstyles",
      "Chuck Taylors"
    ],
    description: "Mike What? is one in a succession of hip porn directors who have been allowed to flourish in recent years. Hiring What? as your director means viewers of your pornography will be treated to a whole array of different color filters as a plotline unfolds where a group of slutty best friends travel back in time to see the last Germs concert. Nothing is actually transgressive here, but it looks alt so that's close enough."

    ],
    description: "he indie world's most beloved of directors spent years making films about the heartache of obsessive pencil collectors, the beauty of women who are ugly, and the personal lives of two people who interrupt each other. Then Hollywood called him, and had him make a movie about Marines on the Moon. This began a series of events that led to porn being Pablo's only creative outlet. A Pablo Impeccable picture is layered with subtext, innovative camera work and gorgeous saturated lighting. Which is great, for the people who would care about this."
