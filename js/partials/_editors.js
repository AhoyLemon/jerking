    name: "you",
    cost: 0,
    talent: 4,
    description: "Sure, you had to hire someone to direct this thing. After all, you don't have a digital video camera and that shit seems hard and boring anyway. But editing? Windows Movie Maker is right there on your computer! Why not take the DIY approach and just put the thing together on your computer?"

    name: "this guy Jacob",
    cost: 50,
    talent: 19,
    description: "You went to school with this guy Jacob, and while he wasn't that fun to hang around with, you mostly tried to be nice to him because occasionally you could convince him to do your homework. Well, now all that goodwill might just pay off, because it's recently occurred to you that Jacob has a copy of Final Cut Pro that he uses to edit homemade Star Trek fan films. He's not all that familiar with how sex is actually supposed to happen, so you might end up losing some of the good footage, but you can probably get a good credit sequence out of it."

    name: "Hair Pi",
    cost: 145,
    talent: 35,
    description: "A staple of the punk rock scene for years, Hair Pi spends most of his time following around different obscure bands, collecting footage filmed by the band members' girlfriends, then editing the footage together into compilation videos to sell on the bands' websites. With some convincing, you could probably encourage him to put together your porno footage for you. But God only knows what he'll splice in the middle."

    name: "Pornotronix Laboritories, Inc.",
    cost: 225,
    talent: 44,
    description: "If you take a backpacking tour through Prague, you just might stumble upon the dingy office building where PL, Inc is housed. Simply use their website to upload all your footage, someone from a team of semi-competent editors will piece together using one of their twelve stylesheets. What you'll get at the end of all this is a porno film that looks mostly like the millions of other porno films that come from Prague, except because of bandwidth restrictions, it'll look like your video was downloaded from YouTube."

    name: "E07A",
    cost: 350,
    talent: 66,
    description: "One of the more recent projects MIT engineers have created in the battle of Technology vs. Art, the E07A is a completely autonomous editing machine capable of splicing, color correcting and sound engineering any raw footage its given, perfect for any video-game related movie cash-in where personal creativity is frowned upon. Through a connection, you could get an engineer to sneak your footage into the F11, but he warns you that it's never done porn before."

    name: "Colin Quigonini",
    cost: 450,
    talent: 77,
    description: "Colin Quiqonini spent considerable time and money constructing and lighting the shelf in his office that hold the three trophies he has been awarded for his editing. Not that you're going to see an Oscar on there, or even an Emmy, but hey - if you're impressed by the Speed Stick by Mennen Award for Excellence in the Field of Editing, you'll be impressed by Colin's."

    name: "The Black Dahlia Part II",
    cost: 950,
    talent: 95,
    description: "Who the hell would decide to name themselves The Black Dahlia, Part II? Rumor is it's one of the most famous editors living today. Perhaps this editor's true identity is Ray Imancola, or perhaps it's Christine Kemp? Or could it.... Could it actually be Paulo Ricarti? Yeah, maybe. Thanks, IMDb."
