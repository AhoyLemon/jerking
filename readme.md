#### (New Parody Porn Titles Every Day)

## What?

So... you know how you keep a list of all the funny parody porn titles you've ever thought of?

## No.

You don't do that?

## No.

Well, I do that.

## Why?

Because it's funny?

Look, I don't know what to tell you here. I had this list sitting around for a couple years, and finally decided to make a website out of it.

There's a big master list of names, and then the site itself will generate a daily list of 20 of those titles as well as their ranking and box office gross, structurally trying to bring you artificial market forces while maximizing funny names.

## I was offended by one of your titles!

Okay. Thanks for stopping by.

## Who made this?

My name is [Lemon](http://ahoylemon.xyz), I made this. My friends helped. A whole lot of people have sent me titles which I've added if I've liked them enough.

## Oooh, I have some more titles for you!

Alright. You can [toot](https://mastodon.social/@ahoylemon) or [email](mailto:lemon@thefpl.us) them to me.

## Aren't you the guy who made [damn.dog](https://damn.dog)?

Yeah.

I also made [Sisyphus Clicker](https://kinda.fun/sisyphus) and [idiots win](https://idiots.win) and... a bunch of other stuff. You can go to [my website](https://ahoylemon.xyz) if you want a list of dumb things I've made. 

## Do you take pull requests?

Maybe? But probably not. Talk to me about it first. I'm not gonna merge any unsolicited PR on this one.
