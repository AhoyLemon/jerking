#### (New Parody Porn Titles Every Day)

## What?
Using its database of names, jerking.online will create a new Top 20 list of porn titles every day.

## Why?
I mean, because it's funny? I had the list of these titles just sitting in a text file for years, I needed to do something with them, this seemed like a thing to do.

## Who?
[Lemon](http://ahoylemon.xyz) made this. [Boots](https://thefpl.us/meet/boots-raingear) helped.

## Oooh, I have some more names for you!
Alright. You can [tweet](https://twitter.com/AhoyLemon) or [email](mailto:lemon@thefpl.us) them to me.

## Aren't you the guy who made [damn.dog](http://damn.dog)?
Yeah.

## You take pull requests?
Sure, but ask first.
